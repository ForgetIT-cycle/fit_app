# FitApp - Project Summary and Run Instructions

## 1. Project Overview

FitApp is a Flutter-based mobile application designed for Android, focusing on helping users track their fitness progress. This initial version prioritizes the **Progress Tracker** feature, allowing users to log workouts and view their activity history and summaries.

## 2. Implemented Features

Based on your requirements and the provided concept images, the following features have been implemented in this initial version:

*   **Core App Structure:**
    *   Flutter project named `fit_app` created and configured for Android.
    *   Scalable folder structure (screens, widgets, models, services, theme, utils).
    *   Custom app theme based on the color scheme and typography observed in the provided images (dark theme with purple and lime green accents).
*   **Navigation:**
    *   **Splash Screen:** A simple introductory screen displayed on app launch.
    *   **Main Screen with Bottom Navigation:**
        *   Home (Placeholder)
        *   Progress (Fully Implemented)
        *   Favorites (Placeholder)
        *   Profile (Placeholder)
*   **Progress Tracker (Core Feature):**
    *   **Workout Log Tab:**
        *   Date selector to view activities for a specific day.
        *   Displays a list of logged activities for the selected date, showing activity name, icon, calories burned, and duration.
        *   Ability to add new workout logs (currently adds a dummy "Evening Walk" entry for the selected date for demonstration; a full input form can be added later).
        *   Data is stored persistently using an SQLite database.
    *   **Charts Tab:**
        *   Displays a bar chart visualizing monthly aggregated activity (e.g., total calories burned per month for the last 4 months). Data is fetched from the SQLite database.
        *   Shows a list of recent activities with their details (date, day, activity name, calories, duration). Data is fetched from the SQLite database.
        *   Includes a pull-to-refresh functionality to reload chart and summary data.
        *   Uses placeholder data if the database is empty or lacks sufficient aggregated data for charts.
*   **Database:**
    *   SQLite database (`FitApp.db`) implemented for local data storage.
    *   Tables created for `UserSettings` (basic structure) and `WorkoutLog`.
    *   Helper methods in `database_helper.dart` for CRUD operations, fetching logs by date, fetching recent logs, and fetching aggregated monthly data for charts.

## 3. Project Structure

The project is located in the `fit_app` directory. Key files and folders include:

*   `fit_app/lib/main.dart`: Main application entry point, theme setup, and initial routing.
*   `fit_app/lib/theme/theme.dart`: Custom `ThemeData` for the app.
*   `fit_app/lib/screens/`: Contains all screen widgets.
    *   `splash_screen.dart`
    *   `main_screen.dart` (handles bottom navigation)
    *   `home_screen.dart` (placeholder)
    *   `progress_tracking_screen.dart` (container for Workout Log and Charts tabs)
    *   `progress_tracking/workout_log_tab.dart`
    *   `progress_tracking/charts_tab.dart`
*   `fit_app/lib/services/database_helper.dart`: SQLite database setup and helper methods.
*   `fit_app/lib/widgets/`: (Currently empty, for reusable custom widgets)
*   `fit_app/lib/models/`: (Currently empty, for data model classes if needed later)
*   `fit_app/pubspec.yaml`: Project dependencies, including `google_fonts`, `provider`, `sqflite`, `path_provider`, `fl_chart`, and `intl`.

## 4. How to Run the App

To run the FitApp on an Android emulator or a connected Android device, follow these steps:

1.  **Ensure Flutter SDK is Installed:**
    *   If you haven_t already, download and install the Flutter SDK from the [official Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
    *   Make sure the Flutter SDK `bin` directory is added to your system_s PATH.
2.  **Ensure Android Development Environment is Set Up:**
    *   Install Android Studio from the [official Android Developer website](https://developer.android.com/studio).
    *   Within Android Studio, make sure you have an Android SDK installed and an Android Virtual Device (AVD) configured, or connect a physical Android device with USB debugging enabled.
    *   Run `flutter doctor` in your terminal. This command checks your environment and displays a report of the status of your Flutter installation. Address any issues marked with an `[âœ—]` or `[!]` before proceeding, especially related to the Android toolchain.
3.  **Extract the Project:**
    *   Extract the provided `fit_app_project.zip` file to a location on your computer.
4.  **Open the Project in Your IDE (e.g., VS Code, Android Studio):**
    *   Open your preferred IDE.
    *   Open the extracted `fit_app` folder as a Flutter project.
5.  **Get Dependencies:**
    *   Open a terminal within the `fit_app` project directory.
    *   Run the command: `flutter pub get`
    This will download all the necessary packages defined in `pubspec.yaml`.
6.  **Run the App:**
    *   Ensure an Android emulator is running or a physical Android device is connected and recognized by Flutter (check with `flutter devices`).
    *   In the terminal (still within the `fit_app` project directory), run the command: `flutter run`
    *   Alternatively, you can use the "Run" or "Debug" option in your IDE (e.g., press F5 in VS Code with the Flutter extension installed).

## 5. Notes and Next Steps

*   **Emulator/Device Testing:** As I cannot test on an emulator/device in this environment, please ensure you test the application thoroughly on your target Android setup.
*   **Adding Workouts:** The "Add Workout" functionality in the Workout Log tab currently adds a predefined dummy workout. This can be expanded to include a form for users to input their own workout details.
*   **User Authentication/Profiles:** User-specific data and profiles are not yet implemented but can be a next step.
*   **Further UI Refinements:** The UI is based on the provided concepts; further refinements and additional screens (Favorites, Profile, detailed workout entry) can be developed.
*   **Error Handling and State Management:** Basic state management with `ChangeNotifierProvider` is set up in `main.dart`. More robust error handling and state management (e.g., using Provider more extensively or Riverpod) can be implemented as the app grows.

Thank you for the opportunity to work on FitApp! I hope this initial version meets your expectations for the core progress tracking feature.
